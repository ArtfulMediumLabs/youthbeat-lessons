    <h2 class="making-music__sub-heading">The Big Ideas in YouthBeat</h2>
    <p>In this tutorial, we explore how music creates emotions through the push and pull of rhythms against the beat, and of melodies against the chord.</p>
    <p>We look at how note colour, volume, tempo, and a variety of highlighting tools draw our attention to these basic patterns, changing how they make us feel.</p>
    <p>Everything is learned hands-on through short experiments. Students then apply each new tool to their own creative projects. Music overlaps in significant ways with language and math, so we include meaningful curriculum connections throughout. </p>
