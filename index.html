    <h2>Rhythm - The Drums</h2>
    <div class="lesson" id="lesson00">
      <p>Rhythm can mean two things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the timing pattern of music - when notes in the music are heard, and</li>
        <li>the music made by the rhythm section - the drums, hi hat, bells, and other instruments whose main job is to bring the timing patterns to life.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="lesson hide" id="lesson01">
      <!-- [bass drum on spaces 0, 4, 8, 12] -->
      <h3>1. The basic beat pattern</h3> 
      <p>There are hundreds or even thousands of musical sounds (called notes) in a piece of music. How do we keep track of them all?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Press Play [insert Play symbol] to listen to this pattern, called ‘the beat’. Press again to stop.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This pattern - the basic beat - helps us keep track of the timing of all the music, just as a clock helps us keeps track of minutes and hours.</p>
      <p>Always start with this basic beat pattern when you’re making a new piece.</p>
      <p>Notice the sounds or notes are all 4 spaces apart. Each group of 4 spaces is called a beat unit. There are 4 beat units to the circle, which stands for one bar of music.</p>
      <p>Did you know: there are 85 or so bars in the average song. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="lesson hide" id="lesson02">
      <h3>2. Edit the sounds </h3> 
      <p>There are 3 different drum sounds in our app: bass drum, snare drum, and rim shot. [Images]</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Change the 2nd and 4th drum sounds above to snare drum: tap the drum name, then the  space in the circle, then press Play.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Notice we now hear 2 pairs of sounds, not 4 individual sounds. Each pair is bass drum-snare drum. This makes us hear the pattern in halves.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Now change the 2nd and 4th sounds to Rim Shot. How is this sound different from the snare drum?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Did you know? Lots of popular music uses a hand clap sound on the 2nd and 4th beats, called a back beat because it’s like the audience clapping back to the bass drum. You can get something like this effect with the rim shot.</p>
